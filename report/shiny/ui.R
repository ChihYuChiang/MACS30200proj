This model is based on multiple player surveys and expert game reviews of major video game information platforms, including GameSpot, GamesRadar, and Polygon, with a total of 15-million words of analysis. This model incorporates multiple machine learning techniques to extract experiential compositions of a video game from a video game specific Word2Vec embedding space.

One is a game's relationship to the Experiential Keyword Groups, English word sets that present corresponding human experiences. Another is a game's relationship to the Experiential Genres. They can be deemed as clusters of the Keyword Groups. For more information about these constructs, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ChihYuChiang/MAPSS-Thesis/blob/master/writing/Thesis%20-%20final%20draft.pdf\">original paper</a>.
