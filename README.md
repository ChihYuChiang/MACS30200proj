## Portray Product Experience by Expert Reviews—<br>Video Game Classification on In-gaming Experiences

How can subjective experiences be logically portrayed? For experience-intensive products, such as video games, where graphic quality, game specifications, and other traditional metrics are deficient in illustrating the diverse gaming experiences players seek for. Product genres (first-person shooters, role-playing, puzzle games, etc.) may serve as one common and simplistic manner of categorizing product experiences. However, they capture only a superficial form of one’s interaction with the product and are hardly indicative of the rich depth of product experiences that one may be exposed to as a user or a player. In this research, I employ video games and their review articles to demonstrate a new analytical scheme that describes product experiences through corresponding product critique reviews, where information of the experiences is extracted via computational content analysis approaches. With a classification model, this scheme connects the real product experience, retrieved from a survey, with experiential information, extracted from the review articles, to provide quality measures for the abstract product experiences in a much objective and cost-effective way.
